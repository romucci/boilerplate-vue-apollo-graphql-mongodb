# Boilerplate Vue + Vuex + Vuetify + Apollo + GraphQL + Express + MongoDB + HTTP/2

Just a simple way of starting your projects with these marvelous technologies!

### Installing
Download or clone the repository and access the server folder

```
- cd server
- npm install 
```

Then navigate towards the client folder and wait for dependencies to finish downloading

```
- cd client
- npm install
```

You will also need to determine your URI for the Apollo Client, the MongoDB connection string, 
your CERT and KEY files for HTTP/2 and the .env file in the server folder.
